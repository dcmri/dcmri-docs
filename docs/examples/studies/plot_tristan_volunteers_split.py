Clinical - rifampicin induced inhibition of liver function
==========================================================

This example illustrates the use of `~dcmri.AortaLiver2scan` for joint 
fitting of aorta and liver signals measured over 2 separate scans. The use 
case is provided by the liver work package of the 
`TRISTAN project <https://www.imi-tristan.eu/liver>`_  which develops imaging 
biomarkers for drug safety assessment. The data and analysis was first 
presented at the ISMRM in 2024 (Min et al 2024, manuscript in press). 

The data were acquired in the aorta and liver of 10 healthy volunteers with 
dynamic gadoxetate-enhanced MRI, before and after administration of a drug 
(rifampicin) which is known to inhibit liver function. The assessments were 
done on two separate visits at least 2 weeks apart. On each visit, the 
volunteer had two scans each with a separate contrast agent injection of a 
quarter dose each. the scans were separated by a gap of about 1 hour to enable 
gadoxetate to clear from the liver. This design was deemed necessary for 
reliable measurement of excretion rate when liver function was inhibited.

The research question was to what extent rifampicin inhibits gadoxetate uptake 
rate from the extracellular space into the liver hepatocytes 
(khe, mL/min/100mL) and excretion rate from hepatocytes to bile 
(kbh, mL/100mL/min). 

2 of the volunteers only had the baseline assessment, the other 8 volunteers 
completed the full study. The results showed consistent and strong inhibition 
of khe (95%) and kbh (40%) by rifampicin. This implies that rifampicin poses 
a risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI), meaning it can cause another drug to 
circulate in the body for far longer than expected, potentially causing harm 
or raising a need for dose adjustment.

**Note**: this example is different to the 1 scan example of the same study in 
that this uses both scans to fit the model.
